# LLMEval

## Project Summary

### One-sentence description of the project
We're developing an automated evaluation framework to objectively compare the performance of multiple Large Language Models across key metrics like relevance, coherence, and factual accuracy, enabling enterprises to make informed decisions when selecting the right LLM for their specific needs.

### Additional information about the project
LLMEval is a comprehensive application designed to systematically evaluate and compare the performance of multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). This tool addresses the growing need for enterprises to make informed decisions when selecting LLMs for specific tasks.
Key Features:

1. Multi-dimensional Assessment: Evaluates LLMs on relevance, coherence, factual accuracy, creativity, and ethical considerations.
2. Advanced Metrics: Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP techniques for objective analysis.
3. Comparative Analysis: Provides consistent, repeatable evaluations across various prompts and domains.
4. Quantitative Insights: Employs statistical modeling to ensure robust, data-driven results.

Objective:
To develop a standardized, efficient framework that enables organizations to assess and compare LLM performances objectively, facilitating strategic decision-making in AI implementation.
This project aims to enhance the selection process of LLMs, ultimately improving the effectiveness and reliability of AI-driven solutions across various industries.
