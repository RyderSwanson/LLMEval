A course for skiing consists of gates made of red and blue poles that skiers must pass between. Men's courses typically have 55 to 75 gates, while women's have 40 to 60. The vertical drop for men is 180 to 220 m, slightly less for women, with gates set up in different configurations to test competitors.
